# Work Sheet Rules
* This file is created to use as a work sheet.
* Work sheet can be used for any thing:
  * Important points
  * Question in the mind
  * Problems
  * Lessons learned from experiences
  * Good sources, books and websites.
  * Plans
  * ....

## Important Points
- The chosen topology: > 3-phase diode rectifier - Buck concerter
## Plans
- **25.11.2020**
  - Buck converter will be researched. 
  - Battery modelling and charging will be researched.
  - The stress on 3-phase diode rectifier can be examined briefly.
## Questions
- If the charging voltage and current is same, the supplied power to battery is the same(?). However, if the mechanical input power is considerably high,
what will be excessive power?
